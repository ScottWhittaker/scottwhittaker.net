    figure {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        margin: 4rem 0;
    }
    figcaption {
        margin-top: 8px;

        font-size: smaller;
    }

A replication of the Github pricing page using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Tailwind appears to divide opinion but I really like working with it. I found I could achieve quality results far quicker than I could trying to hand roll a responsive design. I would love to try Tailwind on a real project.

This is a year old now so the Github pricing page has changed and Tailwind has also advanced, but these replications show how it used to look.
