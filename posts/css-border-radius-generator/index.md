Just another CSS border radius generator to add to the mix. I was starting [this CSS reproduction of a car](/repro/montague-projects/land-rover/) and needed a shape for something which gave me a nice excuse to use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to make a little utility and to learn more about Svelte of course.
