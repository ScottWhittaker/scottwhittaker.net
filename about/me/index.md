My name is Scott Whittaker. From the North but live in the South. London is my temporary home, it has been for a decade now.

I have circa 15 years in web development and I feel like I know less now than when I began. Started out with Perl building mobile thin client business applications for early smartphones (O2 XDA and Palm Treo for example). There was no frontend/backend split, you just did the lot; server side, client side, database and anything else in between.

These days I spend my time on the frontend and in recent years my daily toil has been working on [VOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand) platforms primarily for TV's, set top boxes and games consoles. I have been fortunate working in this sector as it presents some really difficult and unique frontend challenges building video applications that run across multiple devices including but not limited to PS4, Xbox, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, YouView, Sony TV... there are more.

In the 15 years from when I started to the hugely complex present day frontend stack, I have learned that keeping it simple is hard but is always the goal.
