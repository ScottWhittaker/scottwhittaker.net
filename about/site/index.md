<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

Just my corner of the web as they say. It started out as a Jekyll site with all good intentions to write stuff but I rarely did as I discovered that it is much harder creating content than it first appears.

As a result I just put some stuff out there as and when I feel like it. It is primarily for myself in the hope that some things will remain in my head a little longer. It may be snippets of code or some short form tutorial like content.

I once saw someone on twitter link to a post of mine so it helped at least one person out. Other than that it helps me out as it is the place where you are unconstrained by the tooling and requirements of the daily grind and can mess around with things of interest.

And by the way, this site is now built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
